###Using
 The icons on the toolbar are, from left to right:
 
 *  **Bright line** Defeats the sync and single shot
 *  **Single shot** Touch the trigger icon to get a trace
 *  **Trigger** Touch for a trace
 *  **Sync polarity** Reverses the sync polarity
 *  **Timebase** Drops a submenu of timebase timings
 *  **Storage** Does not clear the display between traces
 *  **Clear** Clears the display
 *  **Left** Moves the trace to the left
 *  **Right** Moves the trace to the right
 *  **Start** Moves the trace to the start
 *  **End** Moves the trace to the end
 *  **Spectrum** Spectrum display
 *  **Settings** **Input source** and **About** items

The last two or six items may be on the menu, depending on the size
of the device.

###Scope
Touching the display will produce a vertical index line, which will show the value at that point. The value is arbitrary, as there is automatic gain control on the input so the trace does not get clipped. The position of the index can be finely adjusted by rolling the finger tip. The index can be removed by swiping it off to the left, or touching the Start icon.

In single shot mode the timebase may be changed to zoom in and pan left and right using the right and left icons.

###Spectrum
The spectrum display shows a spectrum with a logarithmic frequency scale. An index line shows the dominant frequency in the input. The frequency is also displayed in the toolbar. To lock the display, touch spectrum display or the lock icon in the toolbar. Touch it again to release the lock.

###Settings
The input source may be selected. Some of the selections will not be
available, depending on the device. The about item shows the version
and copyright.
